#### The nanodegree news app project asks students to use the Guardian News API to fetch JSON data and integrate it into an app for readers to view news related to a certain topic.

My news app will be specifically for any of the users interests.
This is by only taking news content with the keyword that the user inputs. 

1. Parsing JSON data - displays article title, author, date, and section
2. Date formatting for readability
3. Intents to web browser
4. Response messages for no internet connection or no data to load
5. Settings menu, accessible from the action bar
6. "Order By" options for Most Recent and Relevance news items
